# ðŸ“š Literary Network Analysis Using Graph Theory  

This project analyzes the **Poetry (1912-1922) & The Little Review (1914-1922)** dataset using **Graph Theory** to uncover relationships between authors and literary publications. The goal is to model and analyze how authors were connected through these early modernist journals.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Graph Representation**: Nodes (authors & publications) and weighted edges (author-publication relationships).
- **Graph Construction**: Built using **NetworkX** with dataset preprocessing via **Pandas**.
- **Graph Analysis**:  
  - **Degree Centrality**: Identifies influential authors.  
  - **Shortest Path Analysis**: Finds connections between authors.  
  - **Connected Components**: Detects clusters of authors.  
  - **Community Detection**: Finds literary communities using modularity-based clustering.  
- **Graph Visualization**: Color-coded representation of the literary network using **Matplotlib & NetworkX**.
